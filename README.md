## Machine Learning Assignmenets
This repository contains two assignmenets completed in year 3 of university.

- Assignment 1: Develop a simple Nearest Neighbours predictor that can accurately predict labels of two datasets: ionosphere radars and iris flowers.
- Assignment 2: Develop support vector machine, neural network and and cross conformal predictor programs and evaluate them on two datasets: wine and hand written digits (USPS).
